# chainauth-console

This project is a set of static HTML pages that serve the Front End Console for the Chain Auth Solution at [https://console.fusedvr.com](https://console.fusedvr.com).

To test this project locally, install a local https server such as https-localhost.

`npm install -g https-localhost`

And then you can serve the project on Port 5000 so that the console can bypass CORS.

`PORT=5000 serve`
